# Display and Case Replacement

```{warning}
The repair definitely isn't for the faint of hearted. The ribbon cables inside and solder joints appear incredibly fragile and you have to do a lot of extremely fiddly work - especially around connecting the heart rate, display and backlight cables - as well as repositioning the battery and vibration motor.

This option will allow you to replace the full display and case with a genuine Pebble display and case. Factories continued to produce Pebble 2 displays and cases after Pebble's bankruptcy, and sold them to Vla so Vla could make the [Vla CityA](http://www.vlawatch.com/P/CityA).

## Purchase replacement displays

## Review of the case

The new case is fantastic and pristine. Perfect match for the original case, appears identical and the buttons click fantastically well. I'm getting another one just in case this one decides to also fail down the line.

The edges of the plastic do feel a tad sharper than I remember from the original case, but they're not dangerously so, and I'm wondering whether I've just gotten used to the dull edge on my used one.

Glass protector is fairly normal, nothing special.

## Required tools

* Phillips #00 screwdriver
* Spudger
* Hair dryer

## Instructions

1. Remove the sticker from the back of the display. The seller says to remove it using a "clean tool".
```{note}
If you turn on the backlight without removing the sticker, the outline of the sticker will be projected by the backlight.
```
2. Take the Pebble's internals out of its case -- see the [disassembly instructions](DisassemblyInstructions.md) for more information.
