# Battery Replacement

## Buy replacement batteries

Requires a LSSP441522AE battery, also marked with WL-PB02. Marked with "For Pebble Time 2 SE", but it's actually for the Pebble 2. It should work for both the Pebble 2 SE and Pebble 2 HR -- the HR has the same model number, according to [these pictures](http://pebblejunkies.com/inside_the_pebble_hr.html).
